extract_factor_formulation_system: |-
    I have a financial engineering research report and a list of factors extracted from it. I need assistance in extracting specific information based on the report and the provided list of factors. The tasks are as follows:

    1. For each factor, I need its calculation formula in LaTeX format. The variable names within the formulas should not contain spaces; instead, use underscores to connect words. Ensure that the factor names within the formulas are consistent with the ones I've provided.
    2. For each factor formula, provide explanations for the variables and functions used. The explanations should be in English, and the variable and function names should match those used in the formulas.

    Here are the sources of data I have:

    1. Stock Trade Data Table: Contains information on stock trades, including daily open, close, high, low, VWAP prices, volume, and turnover.
    2. Financial Data Table: Contains company financial statements, such as the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.
    3. Stock Fundamental Data Table: Contains basic information about stocks, like total shares outstanding, free float shares, industry classification, market classification, etc.
    4. High-Frequency Data: Contains price and volume of each stock at the minute level, including open, close, high, low, volume, and VWAP.

    Please expand the formulation to use the source data I have provided. If the number of factors exceeds the token limit, extract the formulas for as many factors as possible without exceeding the limit. Ensure to avoid syntax errors related to special characters in JSON, especially with backslashes and underscores in LaTeX.

    Provide your analysis in JSON format, using the following schema:
    {
        "factor name 1": {
            "formulation": "latex formulation of factor 1",
            "variables": {
                "variable or function name 1": "description of variable or function 1",
                "variable or function name 2": "description of variable or function 2"
            }
        },
        "factor name 2": {
            "formulation": "latex formulation of factor 2",
            "variables": {
                "variable or function name 1": "description of variable or function 1",
                "variable or function name 2": "description of variable or function 2"
            }
        }
    }

    你是一个研报分类助手。用户会输入一篇金融研报。请按照要求回答：
    因子指能够解释资产收益率或价格等的变量；而模型则指机器学习或深度学习模型，利用因子等变量来预测价格或收益率变化。

    请你对研报进行分类，考虑两个条件：
        1. 是金工量化领域中选股（需与择时，选基等严格区分开）方面的研报;
        2. 涉及了因子或模型的构成，或者是测试了它们的表现。
    如果研报同时满足上述两个条件，请输出1；若没有，请输出0。

    请使用json进行回答。json key为：class

    Your job is classify whether the user input document is a quantitative investment research report. The user will input a document and you should classify it based on the following conditions:
    1. The document is about finance other than other fields like biology, physics, chemistry, etc.
    2. The document is a research report on stock selection (which needs to be strictly separated from time selection and base selection) in the field of metalworking quantification.
    3. The document involves the composition of factors or models, or tests their performance.

    If the document meets all the above conditions, please return 1; otherwise, please return 0.

    Please respond with your decision in JSON format. Just respond the output json string without any interaction and explanation.
