In modern industry, research and development (R&D) is crucial for the enhancement of industrial productivity, especially in the AI era, where the core aspects of R&D are mainly focused on data and models. We are committed to automate these high-value generic R&D processes through our open source R&D automation tool RDAgent, which let AI drive data-driven AI.

Our RDAgent is designed to automate the most critical industrial R&D processes, focusing first on data-driven scenarios, to greatly boost the development productivity of models and data. 

Methodologically, we propose an autonomous agent framework that consists of two key parts: (R)esearch stands for actively exploring by proposing new ideas, and (D)evelopment stands for realizing these ideas. The effectiveness of these two components will ultimately get feedbacks through practice, and both research and development capabilities can continuously learn and grow in the process.
