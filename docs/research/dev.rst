  Co-STEER is a method to tackle data-centric development (AD2) tasks and highlight its main challenges, which need expert-like implementation (i.e., learning domain knowledge from practice) and task scheduling capability (e.g., starting with easier tasks for better overall efficiency), areas that previous work has largely overlooked. Our Co-STEER agent enhances its domain knowledge through our evolving strategy and improves both its scheduling and implementation skills by gathering and using domain-specific practical experience. With a better schedule, implementation becomes faster. At the same time, as implementation feedback becomes more detailed, scheduling accuracy improves. These two capabilities grow together through practical feedback, enabling a collaborative evolution process.
